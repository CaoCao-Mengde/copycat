Libereus is a self-hosted only Discord moderation bot written in Python 3.6 that aims to make server moderators' lives easier. Initially created as a submission to participate in [Discord Hack Week 2019](https://blog.discordapp.com/discord-community-hack-week-build-and-create-alongside-us-6b2a7b7bba33) and received [second place](https://blog.discordapp.com/discord-community-hack-week-category-winners-bd0364360f92). Our original submission can be found [here](https://github.com/Tansc161/Libereus-DHW19).

It has the ability to:
> ‚úÖ Prune inactive members via their last message's date  
> ‚úÖ Disable or re-enable messaging permissions on a given channel for normal members (channel lockdown)  
> ‚úÖ Detects bad word and give strike to the sender  
> ‚úÖ Remove a prefix from members' nicknames (i.e. usage of `!` to hoist to the top of the member list)  
> ‚úÖ üí£ GENERATE A COOL SPOILER-MINESWEEPER GAME üí£  
> ...and much more!

1. To run the bot, double click "bot.py" or do the following command in the bot's directory.
`py -3 bot.py`

`/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

`brew install python3`
1. Clone this repository's master branch.  
`git clone https://github.com/Tansc161/Libereus.git --branch master`
1. Make a copy of settings.json from the example given.  
`cp settings.example.json settings.json`
1. Use your favourite text editor to edit settings.json or use nano in the Terminal.  
`nano settings.json`
1. Replace "your bot token here" with the bot token that you obtained from Step 5 in "Registering an access token for your bot" above. (Please note that you need to enclose your bot token with "quotation marks".)
1. Save the file. (For nano users, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd>, and then hit <kbd>Y</kbd>, and then hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>.)
